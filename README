# limitations

LIMITATIONS AND EDGE CASES

This implementation leverages compiler-specific cleanup attributes to provide Go-like defer
semantics in C. While powerful, there are important limitations and edge cases to be aware of:

1. COMPILER SUPPORT
   - Only GCC (14.0+) and Clang (16.0+) are supported
   - MSVC and other compilers will trigger a compile-time assertion
   - Implementation differs significantly between GCC and Clang

2. MULTIPLE DEFERS ON SAME LINE (CRITICAL)
   - The UNIQUE_NAME macro uses __LINE__ for name generation
   - Multiple defer statements on the same line will cause name collisions
   - WORKAROUND: Always place defer statements on separate lines

   BAD:  defer({ cleanup_a(); }); defer({ cleanup_b(); });
   GOOD: defer({ cleanup_a(); });
         defer({ cleanup_b(); });

3. VARIABLE CAPTURE (CLANG-SPECIFIC)
   - Clang requires __block qualifier for variables modified in defer blocks
   - Without __block, you'll get "variable is not assignable" errors
   - GCC does not need __block (direct scope access)

   Example:
     __block int counter = 0;  // Required for Clang
     defer({ counter++; });

4. ARRAY CAPTURE (CLANG LIMITATION)
   - Arrays cannot be captured in Clang blocks, even with __block
   - Error: "cannot refer to declaration with an array type inside block"
   - WORKAROUND: Use a pointer to the array instead

   BAD:  int arr[3] = {1, 2, 3};
         defer({ arr[0] = 0; });  // ERROR in Clang

   GOOD: int arr[3] = {1, 2, 3};
         int *p = arr;
         defer({ p[0] = 0; });    // OK

5. VARIABLE NAME COLLISIONS (GCC-SPECIFIC)
   - The GCC implementation uses a cleanup function with a parameter named 'ptr'
   - Local variables named 'ptr' inside defer blocks may cause shadowing warnings
   - WORKAROUND: Avoid naming variables 'ptr' in defer blocks or use different names

6. COMMA OPERATOR IN DEFER BLOCKS
   - Commas are interpreted as macro argument separators by the preprocessor
   - Using comma operator will cause "macro passed N arguments, but takes just 1" errors
   - WORKAROUND: Use semicolons instead

   BAD:  defer({ a = 1, b = 2; });      // ERROR: comma seen as separator
   GOOD: defer({ a = 1; b = 2; });      // OK: semicolon separates statements

7. NON-LOCAL JUMPS (DANGEROUS - CLEANUP BYPASSED)
   - setjmp/longjmp bypasses cleanup attributes entirely
   - Deferred cleanup WILL NOT EXECUTE after longjmp
   - This can lead to resource leaks (memory, file handles, locks, etc.)
   - There is NO WORKAROUND - cleanup attributes are not longjmp-aware

   NEVER use defer with setjmp/longjmp:
     int *data = malloc(100);
     defer({ free(data); });

     if (setjmp(buf)) {
         // Jumped here - defer DID NOT execute, data is leaked!
         return;
     }

8. SIGNAL HANDLERS
   - Abnormal process termination (signals, abort, _exit) may skip cleanup
   - defer is designed for normal control flow only
   - Not a replacement for atexit() or signal-safe cleanup

9. GOTO STATEMENTS
   - goto jumping OVER a defer declaration means defer never executes
   - goto jumping OUT OF a defer scope will execute the defer (as expected)

   Example - defer skipped:
     goto skip;
     defer({ cleanup(); });  // NEVER executes
     skip:

10. EXECUTION ORDER
    - Defers execute in LIFO order (Last In, First Out)
    - Inner scopes execute before outer scopes
    - This matches Go's defer behavior

    Example:
      defer({ printf("1"); });
      defer({ printf("2"); });
      defer({ printf("3"); });
      // Prints: "321"

11. SCOPE BINDING
    - defer is bound to the enclosing scope where it's declared
    - Each loop iteration creates a new scope with its own defer
    - Conditional blocks (if/else) create separate defer scopes

12. VARIABLE LIFETIME
    - Variables captured by defer must outlive the defer's execution
    - Pointers to local variables become invalid if passed to outer scope defers
    - In Clang, blocks capture variables when declared, not when executed

13. THREAD SAFETY
    - defer itself provides no thread synchronization
    - If defer modifies shared state, proper locking is required
    - Multiple threads can safely use defer for thread-local resources

14. RETURN VALUE INTERACTION
    - defer cannot modify function return values
    - defer executes AFTER return value is computed but BEFORE function exits
    - This is the same behavior as Go's defer

15. PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS
    - Each defer creates stack overhead (cleanup function + variable)
    - Clang blocks may have additional runtime overhead (BlocksRuntime library)
    - For tight loops, excessive defer usage may impact performance

16. NESTED DEFER COMPLEXITY
    - Complex nesting with multiple scopes can make control flow harder to follow
    - Execution order may be non-obvious with deep nesting
    - Keep defer usage simple and well-commented

17. DEBUGGING
    - Debugger stepping may be confusing due to cleanup execution
    - Breakpoints in defer blocks may fire during scope exit, not declaration
    - Error messages may reference generated macro names (__defer_var_NNN)

BEST PRACTICES:

1. Use defer primarily for resource cleanup (malloc/free, open/close, lock/unlock)
2. Keep defer blocks simple - just cleanup code
3. Always use __block for mutable variables in Clang builds
4. Avoid defer with setjmp/longjmp entirely
5. Test thoroughly on both GCC and Clang if targeting both
6. Document defer usage in complex functions
7. Consider alternatives (explicit cleanup) if edge cases apply

PORTABILITY NOTES:

- Code using defer is NOT portable to non-GCC/Clang compilers
- Consider #ifdef guards if targeting multiple compilers
- The __block keyword is Clang-specific (define as empty macro for GCC)
- BlocksRuntime library required on Linux with Clang

For production use, weigh these limitations against the benefits of automatic cleanup.
The implementation is well-suited for GCC/Clang-only projects that need RAII-like semantics
in C, but should be used with full understanding of its constraints.
